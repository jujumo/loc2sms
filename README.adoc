== rational

I made it for safety while flying. Specifically, to let my mates know where I am, in case they are wondering if I am safe.

The key features are :

 . *robustness*: always working, I cant forget it, as long as my mobile is on,
 . *reliability*: works even without GSM-data coverage (edge, 3G, 4G),
 . *privacy*: I know who and when is asking for my position.


== install

*_loc2sms_* only works on *_android_*.

Mainly because it relies on an excellent app, namely *_automate_*.
This app allows any non-developer user to build automation through design of block diagrams and flows.
So, before installing *_loc2sms_*, you need to install *_automate_* (see section below).
