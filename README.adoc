each time the app is updated (automatically), it is silently killed. See "know issues" section.

== rational

I made it for safety while flying. Specifically, to let my mates know where I am, in case they are wondering if I am safe.

The key features are :

 . *robustness*: always working, I cant forget it, as long as my mobile is on,
 . *reliability*: works even without GSM-data coverage (edge, 3G, 4G),
 . *privacy*: I know who and when is asking for my position.


== install

Relies on image:assets/ic_launcher-128.png["icon", width=24px] *_automate_*
for image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Android_robot.svg["android",  width=24px] *_android_*.

This app allows any non-developer user to build automation through design of block diagrams and flows.
So, before installing *_loc2sms_*, you need to install *_automate_* (see section below).

 - install image:assets/ic_launcher-128.png["icon", width=24px] *_automate_* app from android store:

 - download *_loc2sms.flow_* link:https://github.com/jujumo/loc2sms/blob/master/bin/Loc2sms.flo?raw=true[github.com],

 - open *_loc2sms.flow_* (it should automatically propose to use _automate_),

 - make sure all privileges are checked, and click on "_start_" button:

 - it should be marked as started,

  - then exit, and check it is working (see __usage__).

NOTE: See more about image:assets/ic_launcher-128.png["icon", width=24px] *_automate_* on link:https://llamalab.com/automate/[llamalab.com].

== usage

make sure (see __install__ for details):

 - image:assets/ic_launcher-128.png["icon", width=24px] *_automate_* is installed (see install section),
 - *_loc2sms.flow_* marked as started,
 - your GPS is on.

Then you can:

 - send an SMS to your phone (you can do it from the phone itself for testing),
 starting with the word __"GPS"__.

== contribute

*_loc2sms_* is a simple script using the graph tool of image:assets/ic_launcher-128.png["icon", width=24px] *_automate_*.

You can simply open it, examine it, and modify it.
Please, provide feedback if you have any comment.

== Known issues

=== SMS not received

"Some messaging apps like Go SMS Pro and Project Fi by Google may prevent other apps from accessing incoming SMS."
-- https://llamalab.com/automate/doc/block/sms_received.html

One user also reported "wifi chat" functionality on Motorola also prevented Automate to read messages. You can disable this option.

To check, I strongly recommend NOT to send loopback sms (same emiter and receiver), but to use another phone.

=== Automate app killed

Automate runs in background all the time.
But each time the app is updated (automatically), it is silently killed. 
You just have to open it to make it operational again.
