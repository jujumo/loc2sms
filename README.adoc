== rational

I made it for safety while flying. Specifically, to let my mates know where I am, in case they are wondering if I am safe.

The key features are :

 . *robustness*: always working, I cant forget it, as long as my mobile is on,
 . *reliability*: works even without GSM-data coverage (edge, 3G, 4G),
 . *privacy*: I know who and when is asking for my position.
